/*Ex 4-4: It’s time to make good on a promise. somewhere in this chapter, we said we’d look for someone “who is older than 21, younger than 35, is female, has a bachelor’s or master’s degree, is unmarried, and speaks hindi or Urdu.” Write a program that prompts the user for these qualifications and then outputs whether they qualify for these very specific requirements. To this end, you should define an integer variable age, a character variable gender (to hold 'm' for male, 'f' for female, etc.), a variable degree of an enumeration type AcademicDegree (possible values: none, associate, bachelor, professional, master, doctor), and three Boolean variables: married, speaks Hindi, and speaks Urdu. Emulate a trivial online job interview, ignore any and all flagrant age and sex discrimination issues, and query your applicant for input on all these variables. people who enter invalid values do not qualify, of course, and should be ruled out as early as possible.*/
